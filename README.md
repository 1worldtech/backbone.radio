# Backbone.Radio

Backbone.Radio is a messaging system for Backbone applications. It takes the precedent
set by Backbone.Events and turns it into a sophisticated pubsub system. First, it
adds two new messaging systems, Commands and Requests, which add a semantic layer to your
communications. It then adds the established concept of a messaging Channel to bind the
three systems together.

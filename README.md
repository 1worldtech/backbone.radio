# Backbone.Radio

Backbone.Radio is a messaging system for Backbone applications. It takes the precedent
set by Backbone.Events and takes it a few steps further. First, it adds two new messaging
systems, Commands and Requests, which add a semantic layer on top of your communications. Then it adds the popular concept of a messaging Channel on top of it all.
